    Two and half years ago, I published a very <a href="/blog/maven-releases-steroids.html">popular</a> <a
        href="/blog/maven-releases-steroids-2.html">article</a>
    <a href="/blog/maven-releases-steroids-3.html">series</a> titled 'Maven Releases on Steroids'. The goal of the
    series was to provide a simple and efficient way to produce releases on a Maven Project. Not only that, but
    it did so in a way that is compatible with Continuous Delivery.</p>

<p>Maven has traditionally required the version number to be present in the project descriptor (pom.xml). This
    concept permeates through all aspects of the Maven ecosystem, culminating with the monstrosity commonly referred
    to as the Release Plugin.</p>

<p>So how big exactly was the improvement of Releases On Steroids over the Release Plugin? See for yourself:</p>

<h3>Fast forward to 2013</h3>

<p>The original article was written in January 2011. Two and a half years have passed, and boy did thing
    change in the
    SCM space! In 2011, CVS was dead and burried, Subversion was well-established and both Git and Mercurial were on
    the rise and battling it out to be the Next Big Thing&trade;.</p>

<p>And then one thing happened: GitHub's popularity exploded. It triggered a mass-exodus from Sourceforge, Java.net
    and Google Code. The SCM war had been decided. Git was the new King of the Hill.</p>

<p>Git then trickled down from its open-source roots into the deep dark SCM alleys of the enterprise, effectively
    relegating Subversion to legacy street.</p>

<p>This change brings a number of advantages, of which one is of particular interest to us today: massively improved
    initial checkout performance.

    <code>git clone</code> is orders of magnitude faster than <code>svn checkout</code>!</p>

<p>The Releases on Steroids process comes from a time where an initial checkout was slow. To keep performance in
    check
    the practice was to update the working copy with the latest changes instead of checking it out fresh every
    time. This meant that for the update to succeed the working copy could not contain local changes, as these would
    cause conflicts.</p>

<p>The Releases on Steroids process went through great lengths (and worked around many Maven bugs) to ensure
    this.</p>

<p>But now with the performance of Git, things have changed. And in change lies opportunity. So let's revisit
    Releases on Steroids and bring it into 2013's brave new world!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Revisiting the Release Process</h3>

<p>Even though technology has evolved, the purpose of a release hasn't. What we want is being able to link a version of
    the
    software as deployed onto a machine back to the matching revision of the source code in SCM. This is essential
    to reproduce bugs and revert to previous versions deterministically if required.</p>

<p>To accomplish this we have to go through a number of steps. At a minimum these include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>checking out the software as it is</li>
    <li>giving it a version so it can be uniquely identified</li>
    <li>building, testing and packaging it</li>
    <li>deploying it to an artifact repository where it can then be picked for actual roll out on target machines
    </li>
    <li>tagging this state in SCM so it can be associated with the matching artifact</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty simple, isn't it?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Releases with Maven and Git</h3>

<p>Let's see what this translates to in a Git and Maven world:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Checking the software out: <code>git clone</code></li>
    <li>Giving it a version: <code>mvn versions:set</code></li>
    <li>Building, testing, packaging and deploying it to an artifact repository: <code>mvn deploy</code></li>
    <li>Tagging this state in SCM: <code>mvn scm:tag</code></li>
</ol>

<p>But first, the POM needs some preparation.</p>

<p>Having the project version come from outside means we can use a simple generic snapshot version for the code
    checking into SCM. Our <code>pom.xml</code> then looks like this:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;project ...&gt;
    ...
    &lt;version&gt;0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
    ...
&lt;/project&gt;</pre>

<p>We can now add our project's Git and artifact repository urls, as well as some basic plugin configuration:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;scm&gt;
    &lt;connection&gt;scm:git:<em>&lt;&lt;your-git-repo-url&gt;&gt;</em>&lt;/connection&gt;
&lt;/scm&gt;

&lt;distributionManagement&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;artifact-repository&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;url&gt;<em>&lt;&lt;your-artifact-repo-url&gt;&gt;</em>&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
&lt;/distributionManagement&gt;

&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.mojo&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;versions-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;2.1&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-scm-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;1.8.1&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                &lt;tag&gt;${project.artifactId}-${project.version}&lt;/tag&gt;
            &lt;/configuration&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;</pre>
<p>And that's it! Nothing more is required!</p>

<p>Now let's take this 11 and integrate it in a CI environment. Jenkins is the absolute
    market leader, so that's what we'll use.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Jenkins integration</h3>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Jenkins with a JDK and Maven configured, and both
    the <em>Git</em> and the <em>Workspace Cleanup</em> plugins installed.</p>

<p>We're going to start by creating a new Maven job and making sure we have a fresh workspace for every build:</p>

<img src="/assets/posts/final-nail/clean.png"/>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can now point the job to our Git repository:</p>

<img src="/assets/posts/final-nail/git.png"/>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next step is to set the version upon checkout. There are two main strategies we can apply:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a parametrized build and pass the version in</li>
    <li>Let Jenkins assign the version</li>
</ul>

<p>In this example we're going to use the latter. A good version number is both unique and chronological. We're
    going to use the Jenkins BUILD_NUMBER as it fulfills both these criteria wonderfully.</p>

<p>So let's set the version in a pre-build step:</p>

<img src="/assets/posts/final-nail/version.png"/>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are now ready to build, test, package, deploy (to the artifact repository) and tag (the Git repository):</p>

<img src="/assets/posts/final-nail/deploy.png"/>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All that is left now is deciding between</p>
<ul>
    <li>Triggering the release build manually (the classic way)</li>
    <li>Polling SCM to release after every commit (the Continuous Delivery way)</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy releasing with Jenkins!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this article we've followed the footsteps of the Releases on Steroids articles and taken the concepts to their
    natural conclusion: <strong>the simplest and most effective way to create releases on projects using Maven and
        Git.</strong></p>

<p>Along the way, we've kept a strong focus on keeping as much knowledge as possible inside the POM. This keeps the
    release process concise and minimizes dependencies on specific environments or CI servers.</p>

<p>So come with me and <strong>wave the Maven Release Plugin goodbye. This was the final nail in its coffin. Good
    riddance.</strong></p>
