    <p>I have been giving talks about Continuous Delivery over the last three years. During these talks,
        I have had the chance to meet lots of interesting people with whom I had many great conversations.</p>

    <p>While talks are great as you can interact and really get the message out, they do have one problem:
        reach. You simply can't pack 20,000 people in one room. I was therefore delighted when Claudia Fröhling,
        the editor-in-chief of <strong>Java Magazin</strong>, asked me to write the leading article for their upcoming
        <a href="https://jaxenter.de/magazines/Java-Magazin-1113-167769">Continuous
            Delivery issue</a>. Java Magazin is Europe's largest print magazine about Java and therefore a great
        platform to spread the word!</p>

    <p>The issue finally got published this week:</p>

    </p>

    <p>It contains both my <strong>article</strong> titled <strong>"Architecting for Continuous Delivery"</strong>
        and an <strong>interview with me</strong> as author of
        the month. The iPad edition also contains a video of my Continuous Delivery talk at JAX 2013 in Mainz.</p>

    <p>So if you speak German, are interested in Continuous Delivery and haven't had a chance to attend one of my talks
        yet, make sure to check it out!</p>

    <h3>Conference speaking tour Fall 2013</h3>

    <p>I started this year with a spring speaking tour which took me to
        <a href="http://2013.33degree.org/speaker/show/36">33rd Degree</a> in Warsaw,
        <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/FR13/Axel+Fontaine">Devoxx FR</a> in Paris,
        <a href="https://2013.con-fess.com/speakers#25">Confess</a> in Vienna and finally
        <a href="http://jax.de/2013/">JAX</a> in Mainz. It was great fun and a good chance to flex my language muscles,
        as I gave talks in French, German and English.</p>

    <p>After the summer break, the conference season has kicked in again. My speaking tour for the fall 2013 already
        took
        me to Oslo for a Flyway talk at <a href="http://jz13.java.no/presentation.html?id=4b026c8d">JavaZone</a>, and to
        Göttingen for a <strong>sold-out</strong> <a
                href="http://www.sourcetalk.de/2013/programm/abstracts/?show=20131002-10-00-trainings-Axel-Fontaine">Continuous
            Delivery workshop</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm in Kiev in the Ukraine this week, as I will giving the <strong>keynote</strong> at the
        <a href="http://xpdays.com.ua/program/#continuous-delivery">XP Days</a> conference, as well as giving a
        Flyway talk later that day. After that in November, I will in Munich for <a
                href="http://jax.de/node/905">W-JAX</a>,
        before heading to Antwerp for <a href="http://www.devoxx.be/dv13-axel-fontaine.html">Devoxx</a>
        and finally to Gothenburg,
        where I will return to <a href="http://www.jdays.se/speakers#AxelFontaine">jDays</a>.</p>

    </p>

    <p>I will then be giving a final talk for this year at the Lightweight Java User Group in Munich to round things
        off.</p>
