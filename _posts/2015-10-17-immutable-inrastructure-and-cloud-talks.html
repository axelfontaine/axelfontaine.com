    <p>2015 has proven to be another very busy year so far. I toured quite a bit, giving lots <a href="/#speaking">conference talks</a> and teaching my
        <a href="/training/continuousdelivery.html">Architecting for Continuous Delivery and Zero Downtime</a> course.</p>
    <p>Here are the slides and the videos of my two latest ones:</p>

    <h3>Immutable infrastructure</h3>
    <p>App deployment and server setup are complex, error-prone and time-consuming. They require OS installers, package managers, configuration recipes, install and deployment scripts, server tuning, hardening and more. But... Is this really necessary? Are we trapped in a mindset of doing things this way just because that's how they've always done?</p>

        <p>What if we could start over and radically simplify all this? What if, within seconds, and with a single command, we could wrap our application into the bare minimal machine required to run it? What if this machine could then be transported and run unchanged on our laptop and in the cloud? How do the various platforms and tools like AWS, Docker, Heroku and Boxfuse fit into this picture? What are their strengths and weaknesses? When should you use them?</p>

        <p>This talk is for developers and architects wishing to radically improve and simplify how they deploy their applications. It takes Continuous Delivery to a level far beyond what you've seen today. Welcome to Immutable Infrastructure generation. This is the new black.</p>

    <h3>Architecture and Deployment of Microservices for the Cloud</h3>

    <p>The case for running an own datacenter is vanishing rapidly. The cloud seduces with a low barrier of entry and full flexibility. Infrastructure can be spun up almost instantly in a fully automated way through an API. All this with no upfront costs and the ability to decommission it just as fast. But what does this mean for our applications and their architecture? Can we just lift and shift them to the cloud?</p>

        <p>Everything comes at a price. To be able to fully leverage the potential of the cloud, new challenges must be mastered: from data privacy and security to cost-based architectures, dynamic provisioning, service discovery and efficient deployment models.</p>

        <p>This talk provides architects and developers clear answers and battle-tested solutions for a successful journey to infrastructure heaven.</p>
