    <p>I've been quite active lately both with doing conference <a href="/#speaking">talks</a> and teaching my
        <a href="/training/continuousdelivery.html">Architecting for Continuous Delivery and Zero Downtime</a> course.</p>
    <p>In the midst of all this, I also had the pleasure to take time to give some interviews. These are the two latest ones.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Yesterday <strong><a href="http://blog.arungupta.me/database-migrations-in-javaee-flyway-hanginar6/">Arun Gupta</a></strong>, of Java EE fame,
        and myself hosted a joint Google Hangout about  <strong>Database Migrations in Java EE using Flyway</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Need for database migration tool in a Java EE application</li>

    <h3>Voxxed interview on the Mainstreaming of Continuous Deployment</h3>

    <p>Back at Devoxx in Antwerp, I sat down with <strong><a href="https://www.voxxed.com/blog/2014/12/axel-fontaine-mainstreaming-continuous-deployment/">Lucy Carey</a></strong>, from
        <a href="https://www.voxxed.com/blog/2014/12/axel-fontaine-mainstreaming-continuous-deployment/">Voxxed</a>,
        where we discussed the mainstreaming of Continuous Deployment and my work at Boxfuse.</p>
