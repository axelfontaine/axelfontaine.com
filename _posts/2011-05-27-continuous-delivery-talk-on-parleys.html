Earlier this month I was at the <a
        href="http://www.bejug.org/confluenceBeJUG/display/BeJUG/Continuous+Delivery">BeJUG</a> in Leuven to present my
<b>Continuous Delivery</b> talk.<br/>
<br/>It was great fun and I really enjoyed meeting lots of interesting people. But what is extra nice about the BeJUG, is that it is organized by
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Stephan007">Stephan Janssen</a> of <a href="http://www.devoxx.com">Devoxx</a> and <a
        href="http://parleys.com">Parleys</a> fame. And so, with the precious help of <a
        href="https://twitter.com/#!/danieldeluca">Daniel De Luca</a> they made the talk <a
        href="http://parleys.com/#id=2443&sl=0&st=5">available online at Parleys.com</a> as well!<br/>
<br/>Here are some pictures of the event (more on the <a
