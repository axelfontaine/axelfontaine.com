<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">It was during the last days of 2010 that <a
        href="http://flywaydb.org/documentation/releaseNotes.html#flyway-1.0">Flyway 1.0</a> saw the light of
    day.<br/><br/>Since then almost 2 years and 11 months have passed. During this time Flyway improved considerably.
    Next to the Maven plugin and API, there is now a <a href="http://flywaydb.org/documentation/commandline/">Command-line
        tool</a> and <a href="http://flywaydb.org/documentation/ant/">Ant tasks</a>. Database support has vastly
    improved with the addition of <a href="http://flywaydb.org/documentation/database/databaseSqlServer.html">SQL
        Server</a>, <a href="http://flywaydb.org/documentation/database/databaseDb2.html">DB2</a>, <a
            href="http://flywaydb.org/documentation/database/databaseDerby.html">Derby</a> and <a
            href="http://flywaydb.org/documentation/database/databaseGoogleCloudSql.html">Google Cloud SQL</a>.
    Meanwhile, all of Flyway's dependencies have been made optional. Flyway now has zero required dependencies! And if
    that wasn't enough, many smaller features have been implemented and countless bugs have been fixed!<br/>

    <br/>It's been quite a ride indeed! And now the next chapter can begin! <a
            href="http://java.dzone.com/announcements/flyway-20-out-order-migrations"><b>Flyway 2.0 was released</b></a>
    a few days ago. The number of download has quadrupled in the last year, and there doesn't seem to be any stopping in
    sight!<br/><br/>To celebrate Flyway's new release, I've also launched a completely redesigned project home page and
    moved it to its own domain:<b> <a href="http://flywaydb.org/">flywaydb.org</a></b><br/><br/>For announcements or
    referencing the project, there is now also an own twitter account: <a href="https://twitter.com/flywaydb"><b>@flywaydb</b></a>.<br/><br/>And
    to make getting started even easier, I also wrote an <b><a href="http://www.methodsandtools.com/tools/flyway.php">introductory
        article</a></b> for <a href="http://www.methodsandtools.com/">Methods &amp; Tools</a>.<br/><br/>The <a
            href="http://flywaydb.org/documentation/roadmap.html">future</a> looks bright! Enjoy!</div>
