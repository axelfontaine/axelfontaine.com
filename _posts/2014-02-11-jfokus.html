    <p>Last week I had a full week of fun at <a href="http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/speakers.jsp#AxelFontaine">Jfokus</a>
        in Stockholm. I had a very busy agenda with:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>a <strong>tutorial</strong> on monday</li>
        <li>a <strong>talk</strong> on wednesday</li>
        <li>a <strong>sold out</strong> post-conference <strong>training</strong> on thursday and friday</li>
    </ul>

    <p>

    <h3>Nighthacking Interview</h3>

    <p>On wednesday I also had the pleasure to sit down with Stephen Chin of <a href="http://nighthacking.com/">Nighthacking.com</a> and the
        Java Youtube channel for an
        interview about Continuous Delivery. I gave a quick demo of things to come in 2014.
        Check it out and <a href="https://boxfuse.com">stay tuned</a>!</p>

    <h3>Additional Continuous Delivery training in Stockholm</h3>

    <p>The Jfokus course sold out very quickly, so we decided to run an additional
        <a href="http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/training.jsp">Architecting for Continuous Delivery: from Zero to Hero</a> training
    in Stockholm on <strong>12-13 March 2014</strong>. Seats are limited and most are gone already, but there are still a few remaining places. So don't wait if you want to participate!</p>

    <p>Looking forward to see you there!</p>
