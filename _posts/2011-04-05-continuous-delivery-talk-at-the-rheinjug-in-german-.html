On Thursday I had the pleasure to go and present my <b>Continuous Delivery</b> talk (in German) at the <a
        href="http://rheinjug.de/"><b>rheinjug</b></a> in DÃ¼sseldorf.<br/>
<br/>I really enjoyed my visit. The organisation was great, and it drew a large and interesting crowd. We had a great Q&amp;A session, and the conversation continued for a few more hours around some fine beers at the social event.
<br/><br/>I've made the slides of the talk available on <a
        href="http://www.slideshare.net/axelfontaine/continuous-delivery-7524266">slideshare</a>:<br/><br/>

<br/>Thanks to everyone who came. I hope you enjoyed it. I sure did :-)
