Last month I finally finished reading a book I've been wanting to read for a long time: William Ury's<br/><a

<b>Negotiation</b> is really only about one thing: <b>getting what you
    want</b>. The prize can be anything from the choice of dinner for this evening, to the amount of your next raise or the details of a new strategic partnership. Private or professional life, it doesn't matter. We negotiate
<b>all the time</b> and the outcome of our negotiations <b>greatly influences</b> our lives.<br/>
<br/>And yet, this is a skill most of us in software engineering <b>didn't receive any formal
    training</b> in. Professionally the matter is even worse. Most of our "opponents", ranging from managers to sales people, have both more practice and better training. This leaves us fighting an uphill battle!
<br/><br/>We must stand up and level the playing field!<br/>
<br/>I found William Ury to be a powerful ally for this quest.<br/>
<br/><b>Highly recommended.</b>
