            <p class="training-title">Effective Database Migrations with Flyway</p>

            <p class="training-type">One day on-site training</p>

            <p class="training-overview">One day of intensive <strong>Flyway</strong> instruction. We begin with a quick overview of what problems
                <strong>database migration</strong> tools set out to solve. We then quickly move into thorough coverage of
                everything from
                Flyway basics to topics like existing project integration, API and build tool plugins. We finally
                cover more
                advanced topics like effective test data management, backward compatible migrations and
                zero-downtime migrations.</p>

            <p>
                This class comes with plenty of hands-on time with Flyway and will take you from complete newcomer
                status to
                Flyway competence, or from passing familiarity to Flyway and database migrations expertise.
