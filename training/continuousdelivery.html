            <p class="training-type">Two day on-site intensive hands-on training</p>

            <p class="training-overview"><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> is all the hype these days. This training
                makes it
                a reality. We start with an overview of what Continuous Delivery is
                and how it can help you. We then quickly dive into the details. You
                will learn what it takes to architect a Java application so that it
                can be delivered continuously into production, with code,
                configuration and database delta, multiple times a day, with <strong>Zero Downtime</strong>.</p>

            <p>
                Buckle up! This class is <strong>intensive</strong> and <strong>hands-on</strong>. You build an entire
                Java web app to the point
                where it deploys continuously, with zero downtime. We tackle
                the hard problems with a battle-tested approach you will be able to apply immediately.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are an architect or a developer and want to gain a solid understanding of the
                techniques you need to make Continuous Delivery and Zero Downtime a success, this training is for you.

                    Attending “Architecting for Continuous Delivery” was very much hands on and inspiring, leaving me
                    with plenty of ideas of how to implement a pipeline in my current project. The course was a mixture
                    of theory, coding and also had enough room for open discussions. I definitely recommend it.

                    The workshop gave me a solid understanding of the theoretical and
                    practical fundaments of Continuous Delivery. It was very inspiring to
                    finally set up a complete pipeline based on a real world example. There
                    was enough time for discussions and questions about specific topics. I
                    highly recommend this course.
