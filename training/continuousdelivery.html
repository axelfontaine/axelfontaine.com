            <p class="training-title">Architecting for Continuous Delivery and Zero Downtime</p>

            <p class="training-type">Two day on-site intensive hands-on training</p>

            <p class="training-overview"><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> is all the hype these days. This training
                makes it
                a reality. We start with an overview of what Continuous Delivery is
                and how it can help you. We then quickly dive into the details. You
                will learn what it takes to architect a Java application so that it
                can be delivered continuously into production, with code,
                configuration and database delta, multiple times a day, with <strong>Zero Downtime</strong>.</p>

            <p>
                Buckle up! This class is <strong>intensive</strong> and <strong>hands-on</strong>. You build an entire
                Java web app to the point
                where it deploys continuously, with zero downtime. We tackle
                the hard problems with a battle-tested approach you will be able to apply immediately.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are an architect or a developer and want to gain a solid understanding of the
                techniques you need to make Continuous Delivery and Zero Downtime a success, this training is for you.

            <p class="training-section-head">Prerequisites</p>

            <p>This training assumes a good understanding of software architecture,
                the Java language, Linux and relational databases in general.
            </p>

            <p class="training-section-head">Format</p>

            <p>Bring your own laptop. You've heard someone talk the talk.<br/><strong>This is where you walk the
                walk.</strong></p>

            <p>We start by a high-level overview of what it means and what it takes to architect an app for Continuous
                Delivery and Zero Downtime.

            <p>

            <p>We then quickly move on and take a deep dive into the practical side of things. Over the course of 14
                carefully crafted exercises
                you will gradually build out a Java web app to the point where it is released and deployed continuously
                with zero downtime.
                All this in a virtual data center set up on your own laptop to simulate real world interactions.</p>

            <p>Finally, we wrap up with a look at where the industry is heading, with new exciting developments like
                Immutable Infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p class="training-section-head">Technologies used</p>

            <p>The training strongly emphasizes principles over technology. This will allow you to apply your newly gained knowledge
                to your projects no matter which technology you use or happens to be in fashion.</p>
            <p>However to illustrate these principles we use a number of tools and technologies including Java, Git, Linux, Vagrant,
                Maven, Jenkins, Artifactory, Flyway, Hsqldb and HAproxy.</p>

                    Attending “Architecting for Continuous Delivery” was very much hands on and inspiring, leaving me
                    with plenty of ideas of how to implement a pipeline in my current project. The course was a mixture
                    of theory, coding and also had enough room for open discussions. I definitely recommend it.

                    finally set up a complete pipeline based on a real world example. There
                    was enough time for discussions and questions about specific topics. I
